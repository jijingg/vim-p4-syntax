# p4 language vim syntax highlighter

The vim syntax highlighter was originally made by [c3m3gyanesh](https://github.com/c3m3gyanesh/p4-syntax-highlighter-collection)

However, the original folder structure is not vim plugin friendly for vim plugin managers such as [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or Vundle, so I copied his vim syntax files and made a new one.

To make vim support .p4 syntax highlighting, just put

`
Plug 'rightson/vim-p4-syntax'
`

in you [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) configuration file, then your are all set after `:PlugInstall`
